title: ðŸ“Š kulana (_kÅ«lana_)
---

KÅ«lana means "status" in hawaiian[*](https://hilo.hawaii.edu/wehe/?q=kulana#w2w2-10743) and that's all this project is about. With this tool on your hand you can fetch the status of nearly every single website, including information about the HTTP status, the response time and the content length.

Possible use cases may be to monitor your hosts or to get if there are any redirections (HTTP status 3xx) or just flex on how small your website is.

_kÅ«lana is brought to you by [ohano](https://ohano.me) ([GitHub](https://github.com/ohanome))._

> Documentation is still WIP but will be finished before version 1.0.0.
